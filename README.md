# Cascade Kinesis Client Library for GO

The **Cascade Kinesis Client Library for GO** (Cascade KCL) enables Go developers to easily consume and process data from [Amazon Kinesis][kinesis].

It is a re-implementation on Amazon's Kinesis Client Library in pure Go without using KCL's multi-language support.
